{-| A `Direction2d` represents a direction like 'up' or 'north' or 'forwards'.
They are represented using X and Y components, and can be converted to vectors
if necessary, but should be thought of as conceptually different. Directions
have several uses, such as:

  - Constructing a vector from a length and direction
  - Determining the component of a vector in a particular direction (for
    example, finding the component of velocity in the up direction to get
    vertical speed)
  - Determining the (signed) angle between two directions
  - Defining the orientation of an axis or reference frame

@docs x, y, positiveX, negativeX, positiveY, negativeY


# Constructors

@docs from, perpendicularTo, orthonormalize, orthogonalize, unsafe


# Conversions

# Coordinate conversions

Like other transformations, coordinate transformations of directions depend only
on the orientations of the relevant frames, not the positions of their origin
points.

For the examples, assume the following frames have been defined:

    upsideDownFrame =
        Frame2d
            { originPoint = Point2d.origin
            , xDirection = Direction2d.positiveX
            , yDirection = Direction2d.negativeY
            }

    rotatedFrame =
        Frame2d.rotateBy (degrees 30) Frame2d.xy
