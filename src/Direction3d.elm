{-| A `Direction3d` represents a direction like 'up' or 'north' or 'forwards'.
They are represented using X, Y and Z components, and can be converted to
vectors if necessary, but should be thought of as conceptually different.
Directions have several uses, such as:

  - Constructing a vector from a length and direction
  - Determining the component of a vector in a particular direction (for
    example, finding the component of velocity in the up direction to get
    vertical speed)
  - Determining the angle between two directions
  - Defining the orientation of an axis, plane or reference frame

# Constants

@docs x, y, z, positiveX, negativeX, positiveY, negativeY, positiveZ, negativeZ


# Constructors

@docs from, on, fromAzimuthAndElevation, perpendicularTo, perpendicularBasis, orthonormalize, orthogonalize, unsafe


# Properties

# Comparison

@docs equalWithin


# Measurement

@docs componentIn, angleFrom


# Conversion

@docs reverse, rotateAround, mirrorAcross, projectOnto


# Coordinate conversions

Like other transformations, coordinate transformations of directions depend only
on the orientations of the relevant frames, not their positions.

For the examples, assume the following definition of a local coordinate frame,
one that is rotated 30 degrees counterclockwise around the Z axis from the
global XYZ frame:

    rotatedFrame =
        Frame3d.xyz
            |> Frame3d.rotateAround Axis3d.z (degrees 30)

{-| Project a direction into a given sketch plane. Conceptually, this finds the
[orthographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_projection)
of the direction onto the plane, re-normalizes it to have unit length, and then
expresses the projected direction in 2D sketch coordinates.

This is only possible if the direction is not perpendicular to the sketch
plane; if it is perpendicular, `Nothing` is returned.
