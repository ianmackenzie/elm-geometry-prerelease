{-| A `Frame3d` has an origin point and a set of X, Y and Z directions (which are
always perpendicular to each other). It can be thought of as:

  - A local coordinate system: Most geometric types have associated `relativeTo`
    and `placeIn` functions that convert values of that type from global
    coordinates to local coordinates in a particular frame, and vice versa.
  - A set of axes and planes: It is often convenient to (for example) rotate
    around the Z axis of a frame, or mirror across its XY plane. Frames can
    also themselves be translated, rotated and mirrored!
  - A combined 3D position and orientation: For example, a `Frame3d` could be
    used to define the position and orientation of a spaceship in a 3D game.
    Movement of the ship would then be done by translating and rotating the
    frame.

# Constants

# Constructors

The `withXDirection`, `withYDirection` and `withZDirection` functions all
construct a new `Frame3d` with the given axis direction, having the given origin
point. The other two directions will be chosen arbitrarily. This can be useful
when constructing 'scratch' frames where (for example) you want a particular Z
direction but the specific X/Y directions are unimportant:

    zDirection =
        Direction3d.fromAzimuthAndElevation
            (degrees 0)
            (degrees 60)

    frame =
        Frame3d.withZDirection zDirection Point3d.origin

    Frame3d.zDirection frame
    --> Direction3d.fromAzimuthAndElevation
    -->     (degrees 0)
    -->     (degrees 60)

    Frame3d.originPoint frame
    --> Point3d.origin

    Frame3d.xDirection frame
    --> Direction3d.fromAzimuthAndElevation
    -->     (degrees 0)
    -->     (degrees -30)

    Frame3d.yDirection frame
    --> Direction3d.y

No guarantees are given about the other two directions other than that the three
directions will be mutually perpendicular, and will be oriented so that the
resulting frame is [right-handed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#Orientation_and_handedness).

# Properties

@docs originPoint, xDirection, yDirection, zDirection, isRightHanded


## Axes

@docs xAxis, yAxis, zAxis


## Planes

The following functions all return planes with the same origin point as the
given frame, but with varying normal directions. In each case the normal
direction of the resulting plane is given by the cross product of the two
indicated basis directions (assuming a right-handed frame); for example,

    Frame3d.xyPlane Frame3d.xyz
    --> Plane3d.through Point3d.origin
    -->     Direction3d.positiveZ

since the cross product of the X and Y basis directions of a frame is equal to
its Z basis direction. And since reversing the order of arguments in a cross
product reverses the sign of the result,

    Frame3d.yxPlane Frame3d.xyz
    --> Plane3d.through Point3d.origin
    -->     Direction3d.negativeZ

@docs xyPlane, yxPlane, yzPlane, zyPlane, zxPlane, xzPlane


## Sketch planes

These functions all form a `SketchPlane3d` from two axes of the given frame. The
X and Y axes of the sketch plane will correspond to the two indicated axes. For
example,

    yzSketchPlane =
        Frame3d.yzSketchPlane Frame3d.xyz

    SketchPlane3d.originPoint yzSketchPlane
    --> Point3d.origin

    SketchPlane3d.xDirection yzSketchPlane
    --> Direction3d.y

    SketchPlane3d.yDirection yzSketchPlane
    --> Direction3d.z

Note that this can be confusing - for example, a local X coordinate in the above
sketch plane corresponds to a global Y coordinate, and a local Y coordinate
corresponds to a global Z coordinate!

{-| Rotate a frame around one of its own axes by a given angle (in radians).

The first argument is a function that returns the axis to rotate around, given
the current frame. The majority of the time this will be either `Frame3d.xAxis`,
`Frame3d.yAxis` or `Frame3d.zAxis`. Compare the following to the above example
for `rotateAround`:

    frame =
        Frame3d.atPoint
            (Point3d.fromCoordinates ( 2, 1, 3 ))

    rotatedFrame =
        frame

    --> Direction3d.y

    Frame3d.yDirection rotatedFrame
    --> Direction3d.negativeX

    Frame3d.zDirection rotatedFrame
    --> Direction3d.z

Since the rotation is done around the frame's own Z axis (which passes through
the frame's origin point), the origin point remains the same after rotation.

In this example the frame's Z axis has the same orientation as the global Z axis
so the frame's basis directions are rotated the same way, but in more complex
examples involving rotated frames a rotation around (for example) the frame's
own Z axis may be completely different from a rotation around the global Z axis.

{-| Translate a frame along one of its own axes by a given distance.

The first argument is a function that returns the axis to translate along, given
the current frame. The majority of the time this will be either `Frame3d.xAxis`,
`Frame3d.yAxis` or `Frame3d.zAxis`.

This function is convenient when constructing frames via a series of
transformations. For example,

    point =
        Point3d.fromCoordinates ( 2, 0, 0 )

    frame =

            |> Frame3d.translateAlongOwn Frame3d.xAxis 2

means "construct a frame at the point (2, 0, 0), rotate it around its own Z axis
counterclockwise by 45 degrees, then translate it along its own (rotated) X axis
by 2 units", resulting in
