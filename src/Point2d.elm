{-| A `Point2d` represents a position in 2D space and is defined by its X and Y
coordinates. This module contains a variety of point-related functionality, such
as

  - Measuring distance between points
  - Scaling, rotating, translating, mirroring and projecting points
  - Converting points between different coordinate systems

Points are distinct from vectors but interact with them in well-defined ways;
you can translate a point by a vector to result in a new point, or you can
compute the vector from one point to another, but you cannot 'add' two points
like you can add two vectors.

it is behind, with 'ahead' and 'behind' defined by the direction of the axis.
