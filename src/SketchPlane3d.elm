{-| A `SketchPlane3d` represents a 2D planar coordinate system in 3D space, and
is defined by its origin point and X and Y directions (which are always
perpendicular to each other). Sketch planes are the primary tool for converting
back and forth between 2D and 3D coordinates:

  - 3D geometry such as points, directions and line segments can be projected
    _into_ a sketch plane, which effectively projects the geometry _onto_ the
    sketch plane and then expresses the projected geometry _in_ 2D coordinates.
  - 2D geometry can be place _onto_ a sketch plane to result in 3D geometry. For
    example, a 2D point placed onto a sketch plane will result in a 3D point
    _on_ that sketch plane that has the given 2D coordinate _in_ the sketch
    plane.

This allows you to create algorithms that project from 3D into 2D, perform some
calculations in 2D, then convert the result back to 3D.

Many 3D data types have `projectInto` functions that return the corresponding 2D
data type, and `on` functions for converting back to 3D. For example,
[`Triangle3d.projectInto`](Triangle3d#projectInto) returns a `Triangle2d` and
[`Triangle3d.on`](Triangle3d#on) returns a `Triangle3d`. These pairs of
functions are almost, but not quite, inverses of each other:

    triangle2d
        |> Triangle3d.on sketchPlane
        |> Triangle3d.projectInto sketchPlane

will just return the original `triangle2d` value (within roundoff error), while

    triangle3d
        |> Triangle3d.projectInto sketchPlane
        |> Triangle3d.on sketchPlane

is equivalent to

    triangle3d
        |> Triangle3d.projectOnto
            (SketchPlane3d.toPlane sketchPlane)
