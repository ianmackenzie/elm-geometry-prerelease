{-| A `Vector2d` represents a quantity such as a displacement or velocity in 2D, and
is defined by its X and Y components. This module contains a variety of
vector-related functionality, such as

  - Adding or subtracting vectors
  - Finding the lengths of vectors
  - Rotating vectors
  - Converting vectors between different coordinate systems

Note that unlike in many other geometry packages where vectors are used as a
general-purpose data type, `elm-geometry` has separate data types for vectors,
directions and points. In most code it is actually more common to use `Point2d`
and `Direction2d` than `Vector2d`, and much code can avoid working directly with
`Vector2d` values at all!

@docs Vector2d


# Constants

@docs zero

Although there are no predefined constants for the vectors with components
(1,&nbsp;0) and (0,&nbsp;1), in most cases you will actually want their
`Direction2d` versions [`Direction2d.x`](Direction2d#x) and [`Direction2d.y`](Direction2d#y).


# Constructors

@docs fromComponents, fromPolarComponents, from, withLength, perpendicularTo, interpolateFrom


# Properties

@docs components, xComponent, yComponent, polarComponents, length, squaredLength, direction, lengthAndDirection


# Comparison

@docs equalWithin


# Measurement

@docs componentIn


# Arithmetic

@docs sum, difference, dotProduct, crossProduct


# Transformations

Note that for `mirrorAcross` and `projectOnto`, only the direction of the axis
affects the result, since vectors are position-independent. Think of
mirroring/projecting a vector across/onto an axis as moving the vector so its
tail is on the axis, then mirroring/projecting its tip across/onto the axis.

@docs reverse, normalize, scaleBy, rotateBy, rotateClockwise, rotateCounterclockwise, mirrorAcross, projectionIn, projectOnto


# Coordinate conversions

Like other transformations, coordinate conversions of vectors depend only on the
orientations of the relevant frames, not the positions of their origin points.

For the examples, assume the following frame has been defined:

    rotatedFrame =
        Frame2d.rotateBy (degrees 30) Frame2d.xy

This combined with Elm's built-in tuple destructuring provides a convenient way
to extract both the X and Y components of a vector in one line of code:

    y


{-| Find the component of a vector in an arbitrary direction, for example

    forwardSpeed =
        Vector2d.componentIn forwardDirection velocity

This is more general and flexible than using `xComponent` or `yComponent`, both
of which can be expressed in terms of `componentIn`; for example,

    Vector2d.xComponent vector

is equivalent to

    Vector2d.componentIn Direction2d.x vector

-}

between the two given vectors has magnitude less than the given tolerance.

    Vector2d.length (Vector2d.fromComponents ( 3, 4 ))
    --> 5

-}
length : Vector2d -> Float
length vector =
    sqrt (squaredLength vector)


{-| Get the squared length of a vector. `squaredLength` is slightly faster than
`length`, so for example

    Vector2d.squaredLength vector > tolerance * tolerance

is equivalent to but slightly more efficient than

    Vector2d.length vector > tolerance

since the latter requires a square root under the hood. In many cases, however,
the speed difference will be negligible and using `length` is much more
readable!

vector, returns `Nothing`.

{-| Normalize a vector to have a length of one. Zero vectors are left as-is.

    Vector2d.normalize vector
    --> Vector2d.fromComponents ( 0.6, 0.8 )

    Vector2d.normalize Vector2d.zero
    --> Vector2d.zero

**Warning**: `Vector2d.direction` is safer since it forces you to explicitly
consider the case where the given vector is zero. `Vector2d.normalize` is
primarily useful for cases like generating WebGL meshes, where defaulting to a
zero vector for degenerate cases is acceptable, and the overhead of something
like

    Vector2d.direction vector
        |> Maybe.map Direction2d.toVector
        |> Maybe.withDefault Vector2d.zero

(which is functionally equivalent to `Vector2d.normalize vector`) is too high.

{-| Find the scalar 'cross product' of two vectors in 2D. This is defined as

    crossProduct firstVector secondVector =

                components secondVector
        in
        x1 * y2 - y1 * x2

and is useful in many of the same ways as the 3D cross product:

  - Its length is equal to the product of the lengths of the two given vectors
    and the sine of the angle between them, so it can be used as a metric to
    determine if two vectors are nearly parallel.
  - The sign of the result indicates the direction of rotation from the first
    vector to the second (positive indicates a counterclockwise rotation and
    negative indicates a clockwise rotation), similar to how the direction of
    the 3D cross product indicates the direction of rotation.

Some examples:

        Vector2d.fromComponents ( 2, 0 )

    secondVector =
