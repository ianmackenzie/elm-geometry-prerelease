{-| A `Vector3d` represents a quantity such as a displacement or velocity in 3D, and
is defined by its X, Y and Z components. This module contains a variety of
vector-related functionality, such as

  - Adding or subtracting vectors
  - Finding the lengths of vectors
  - Rotating vectors
  - Converting vectors between different coordinate systems

Note that unlike in many other geometry packages where vectors are used as a
general-purpose data type, `elm-geometry` has separate data types for vectors,
directions and points. In most code it is actually more common to use `Point3d`
and `Direction3d` than `Vector3d`, and much code can avoid working directly with
`Vector3d` values at all!

@docs Vector3d


# Predefined vectors

@docs zero

Although there are no predefined constants for the vectors with components
(1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0), (0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;0) and (0,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1), in most cases
you will actually want their `Direction3d` versions [`Direction3d.x`](Direction3d#x),
[`Direction3d.y`](Direction3d#y) and [`Direction3d.z`](Direction3d#z).


# Constructors

@docs fromComponents, from, withLength, on, perpendicularTo, interpolateFrom


# Components

@docs components, xComponent, yComponent, zComponent, length, squaredLength, direction, lengthAndDirection


# Comparison

@docs equalWithin


# Measurement

@docs componentIn


# Arithmetic

@docs sum, difference, dotProduct, crossProduct


# Transformations

Note that for all transformations, only the orientation of the given axis or
plane is relevant, since vectors are position-independent. Think of transforming
a vector as placing its tail on the relevant axis or plane and then transforming
its tip.

@docs reverse, normalize, scaleBy, rotateAround, mirrorAcross, projectionIn, projectOnto


# Coordinate conversions

Like other transformations, coordinate transformations of vectors depend only on
the orientations of the relevant frames/sketch planes, not their positions.

For the examples, assume the following definition of a local coordinate frame,
one that is rotated 30 degrees counterclockwise around the Z axis from the
global XYZ frame:

    rotatedFrame =
        Frame3d.rotateAround Axis3d.z (degrees 30) Frame3d.xyz

This combined with Elm's built-in tuple destructuring provides a convenient way
to extract the X, Y and Z components of a vector in one line of code:

This is more general and flexible than using `xComponent`, `yComponent` or
`zComponent`, all of which can be expressed in terms of `componentIn`; for
example,

    Vector3d.zComponent vector

is equivalent to

    Vector3d.componentIn Direction3d.z vector

length vector =

{-| Get the squared length of a vector. `squaredLength` is slightly faster than
`length`, so for example

    Vector3d.squaredLength vector > tolerance * tolerance

is equivalent to but slightly more efficient than

    Vector3d.length vector > tolerance

since the latter requires a square root under the hood. In many cases, however,
the speed difference will be negligible and using `length` is much more
readable!

**Warning**: `Vector3d.direction` is safer since it forces you to explicitly
consider the case where the given vector is zero. `Vector3d.normalize` is
primarily useful for cases like generating WebGL meshes, where defaulting to a
zero vector for degenerate cases is acceptable, and the overhead of something
like

        |> Maybe.withDefault Vector3d.zero

(which is functionally equivalent to `Vector3d.normalize vector`) is too high.
