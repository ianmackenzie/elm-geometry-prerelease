{-| For any given set of distinct (non-equal) points in 2D, there is a finite
region around each point such that anywhere in the region is closer to that
point than to any other point. These are the called the Voronoi regions of each
point, and the collection of the Voronoi regions for a set of points is called
the [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) of those
points.

Although some Voronoi regions will be infinite in size, if they are all clipped
to a particular bounding box then they will all be finite, convex polygons. This
module therefore provides functionality for:

  - Building Voronoi diagrams from sets of points or arbitrary vertices (so
    you can associate colors, IDs or other data with points)
  - Adding new points/vertices to an existing Voronoi diagram
  - Clipping a Voronoi diagram to a particular bounding box to get a list of
    polygons with their associated points/vertices

The returned polygons can then be used in various interesting ways:

  - Use to do interesting geographical analyses (for example, what are the areas
    covered by different fire stations?)
  - Use as an invisible hover target in SVG to highlight corresponding points:
    highlighting a given point when the mouse is over its Voronoi polygon is one
    way to highlight the point nearest the mouse

The current implementation is somewhat inefficient, but there are plans to speed
it up in the future (without requiring any changes to the API).

# Construction

Constructing a Voronoi diagram from points/vertices is currently an O(n^2)
operation but should be O(n log n) in the future.

@docs empty

@docs fromPoints, fromVerticesBy


# Modification

Inserting a point into a Voronoi diagram is currently an O(n) operation but
should be O(log n) in the future.

@docs insertPoint, insertVertexBy


# Properties

{-| Convert a Voronoi diagram to a list of polygons, by clipping each (possibly
infinite/unbounded) Voronoi region to the given bounding box. Each item in the
returned list will be an input vertex with its corresponding (clipped) Voronoi
region.

If the bounding box contains all vertices, then there will be an entry in the
list for every vertex. However, if some vertices fall outside the given
bounding box, then it is possible that their Voronoi region is also entirely
outside the bounding box, in which case they will have no entry in the
returned list.

Complexity should be O(n) in the vast majority of cases but may be O(n log n)
in pathological cases (such as 1000 points on a circle surrounding a single
center point, in which case the Voronoi region for the center point will be
a polygon with 1000 edges).
